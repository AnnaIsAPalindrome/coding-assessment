# LabCorp Clinical Development Angular Developer Assessment

Thank you for your interest in working with us at LabCorp! This project is a fork of [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/)

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fork this repo and make the site functionally equivalent to: [http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/).

The previous developer left the project half-finshed, but quite a bit of infrastructure is in place and we'd like to see how you would finish it out.

- All of the styling for the app is complete and almost all of the HTML markup you'll need is present in the app.component.html file.
- In order to complete this project, you're going to have to have knowledge of [Ngrx](https://ngrx.io/), inter-component communication and how to make components re-usable.
- You may **not** use Ngrx/Data or Ngrx/Entities to complete this project.
- It isn't necessary to write end-to-end tests for your work, but if you choose to write unit tests for your reducer actions or components, it would be a big plus.
- Your code must pass AOT compilation when running: `ng build`
- Neatness and organization count!

## Editing a todo

When editing a todo, you'll need to modify your form's HTML input class attribute to "edit". To make the form visible, you will need to make the form appear after the div classed "view" in the markup.

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
